# Recipe Suggestion Based on Ingredients
The main goal of this website is to be a place where users around the world can look for recipes when they already have food available at their home. 
Users will input the list of ingredients that they have in their fridges, then the website will provide recipes that can be cooked. 
Additionally, end users can save the recipes for later use when they login. 
Moreover, we are expecting that this website will be able to reduce the amount of wasted food.
